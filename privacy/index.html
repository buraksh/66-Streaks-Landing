                <p>66-Day Streak ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy
                    explains how our mobile application ("App") handles information. By using 66-Day Streak, you agree
                    to the practices described in this policy.</p>

                <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
                <p><strong>We do not collect any personal information.</strong> 66-Day Streak is designed to operate
                    entirely offline and locally on your device.</p>
                <p>The App stores the following data locally on your device:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Habit names and icons you create</li>
                    <li>Streak progress and check-in dates</li>
                    <li>Reminder times and notification preferences</li>
                    <li>App appearance settings (theme preference)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This data is never transmitted to any server, cloud service, or third party.</p>

                <h2>2. Data Storage</h2>
                <p>All data is stored exclusively on your device using Apple's local storage frameworks (SwiftData). We
                    do not operate any servers, databases, or cloud infrastructure. Your data remains on your device at
                    all times.</p>

                <h2>3. No Account Required</h2>
                <p>66-Day Streak does not require you to create an account, provide an email address, or share any
                    personal information to use the App. There is no login, registration, or authentication process.</p>

                <h2>4. No Analytics or Tracking</h2>
                <p>We do not use any analytics services, tracking pixels, advertising SDKs, or third-party libraries
                    that collect user data. We do not track your behavior, usage patterns, or any other activity within
                    the App.</p>

                <h2>5. Notifications</h2>
                <p>66-Day Streak may send local notifications to remind you about your habits. These notifications are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Generated and scheduled entirely on your device</li>
                    <li>Never processed by external servers</li>
                    <li>Fully customizable and can be disabled in your device settings</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
                <p>66-Day Streak does not integrate with any third-party services, APIs, or SDKs. The App functions
                    entirely independently and does not communicate with any external systems.</p>

                <h2>7. Data Sharing</h2>
                <p><strong>We do not share, sell, trade, or transfer your data to any third party.</strong> Since all
                    data is stored locally on your device and never leaves it, there is no data available for us to
                    share.</p>

                <h2>8. Data Deletion</h2>
                <p>You can delete all your data at any time by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Using the "Erase All Data" option in the App's Settings</li>
                    <li>Deleting the App from your device (this permanently removes all locally stored data)</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>9. Data Security</h2>
                <p>Your data is protected by your device's built-in security features, including device encryption and
                    biometric locks. Since your data never leaves your device and is never transmitted over the
                    internet, it is not subject to network-based security risks.</p>

                <h2>10. Children's Privacy</h2>
                <p>66-Day Streak does not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13. Since the
                    App does not collect any personal information from any user, there is no risk of children's data
                    being collected or processed.</p>

                <h2>11. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
                <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with
                    an updated "Last updated" date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>
